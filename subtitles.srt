00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
 Donald,  what's  this

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,500
 docker  thing  that

3
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:01,980
 I've  been  hearing

4
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:02,299
 about?

5
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,080
 Peter,  docker  is

6
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,400
 a  tremendous  technology,

7
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,120
 believe  me.

8
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:08,000
 It's  a  containerization

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,199
 platform  that  allows

10
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:10,460
 developers  to  pack

11
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,220
 and  ship  and

12
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,060
 run  applications

13
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,160
 in  containers.

14
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,119
 Containers?

15
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,000
 Like  the  ones

16
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,580
 I  used  to

17
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,000
 store  in  my

18
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,239
 beer?

19
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,760
 No,  no,  Peter,

20
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,359
 it's  not  the

21
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:18,940
 same  thing.

22
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,120
 Docker  containers  are

23
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,219
 lightweight  and  portable,

24
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,239
 making  it  easy

25
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:23,100
 to  deploy  and

26
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,140
 scale  applications.

27
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:24,920
 I  see.

28
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:25,480
 So  it's  like

29
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,260
 a  special  box

30
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:26,879
 for  my  apps.

31
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,859
 Exactly,  Peter,  and

32
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:29,600
 docker  has  a

33
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,620
 huge  community  of

34
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,119
 developers  and  users

35
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,100
 who  contribute  to

36
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,039
 its  ecosystem.

37
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:35,020
 Wow,  it's  a

38
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,640
 lot  of  people.

39
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,659
 I  get  started

40
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:37,240
 with  docker.

41
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,640
 Well,  Peter,  you

42
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,399
 can  start  by

43
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:40,679
 learning  about  docker's

44
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,200
 core  concepts,  such

45
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,640
 as  images,

46
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:44,060
 containers,  and  volumes.

47
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:44,840
 Images?

48
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:45,880
 Like  the  ones

49
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,460
 I  take  with

50
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:46,979
 my  camera.

51
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:47,820
 Ha!

52
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,700
 No,  Peter,  docker

53
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,679
 images  are  templates

54
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:51,840
 for  building  containers,

55
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,000
 and  volumes  are

56
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,280
 a  way

57
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,140
 to  persist  data

58
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:54,859
 and  containers.

59
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:55,640
 Okay.

60
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,859
 Thanks,  Donald.

61
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,439
 You're  welcome,  Peter.

62
00:00:58,899 --> 00:00:59,600
 Docker  is  going

63
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,179
 to  be  huge,

64
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:00,939
 just  huge.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
 Stewie,  what's  the

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,280
 full  form  of

3
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:01,480
 USB?

4
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,020
 Ah,  Peter,  it's

5
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,599
 universal  serial  bus,

6
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:05,320
 of  course.

7
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,719
 Universal  serial  bus,

8
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,639
 that's  a  mouthful.

9
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,119
 Yes,  Peter,  it's

10
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:10,359
 a  standard  interface

11
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:11,599
 for  connecting  devices

12
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:12,619
 to  a  computer.

13
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:13,539
 I  see,  so

14
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:13,859
 it's  like  a

15
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:14,820
 special  highway  for

16
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,119
 data?

17
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,500
 Exactly,  Peter.

18
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,059
 And  USB  has

19
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:18,920
 evolved  over  the

20
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,199
 years

21
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,420
 to  support  faster

22
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,420
 speeds  and  more

23
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,019
 devices.

24
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,059
 Wow,  I  had

25
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:23,579
 no  idea  it

26
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:24,199
 was  so  complex.

27
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,859
 Well,  Peter,  it's

28
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,280
 actually  quite  simple

29
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,239
 once  you  understand

30
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:28,620
 it.

31
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,440
 Okay,  so  what

32
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,399
 about  USB -A,

33
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:31,420
 USB -B,  and

34
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,079
 USB -C?

35
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,159
 Ah,  Peter,  those

36
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:33,899
 are  just  different

37
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:34,799
 types  of  USB

38
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:35,560
 connectors.

39
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,799
 Types  of  connectors?

40
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:37,700
 I  thought  they

41
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,759
 were  different  versions.

42
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,240
 No,  Peter,  they're

43
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,240
 just  different  shapes

44
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,979
 and  sizes.

45
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:42,880
 I  get  it

46
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,840
 now,  thanks  Stewie.

47
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:45,200
 Any  time,  Peter.

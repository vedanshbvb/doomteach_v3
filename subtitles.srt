1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
 Elon,  folks,  I'm

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:01,800
 telling  you,  I

3
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,200

4
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,660

6
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,960
 Donald  Oz  is

7
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,000
 a  comprehensive  cloud

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,119
 computing  platform  that

9
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:08,699
 offers  a  wide

10
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:09,539
 range  of  services.

11
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,140
 That's  right,  Elon.

12
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:11,880
 It's  a  big

13
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,919
 league  platform,  the

14
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:13,800
 best,  the  greatest,

15
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:15,140
 the  fantastic,  yes.

16
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,660
 I'll  provide  services

17
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,440
 such  as  compute,

18
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,019
 storage,  database,  analytics,

19
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:19,820
 machine  learning.

20
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:21,940
 More.

21
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:22,780
 I  see.

22
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:23,500
 So  it's  like

23
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,179
 a  big  league

24
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:25,000
 hotel  for  your

25
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,420
 data.

26
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:26,679
 Exactly,  Donald.

27
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,199
 And  has  a

28
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,199
 global  infrastructure  with

29
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,300
 24,  seven  support,

30
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,320
 a  wide  range

31
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,140
 of  tools  and

32
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:32,659
 services.

33
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:34,460
 That's  amazing,  Elon.

34
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,219
 You're  a  genius,

35
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,000
 a  real  winner.

36
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:36,979
 Thanks,  Donald.

37
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:37,759
 I'm  just  trying

38
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:38,259
 to  help  people

39
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:39,119
 understand  this  complex

40
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,600
 technology  complex.

41
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,060
 Oz  is  not

42
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:42,579
 complex.

43
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:43,219
 It's  simple.

44
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:44,159
 It's  easy.

45
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:44,960
 It's  tremendous.

46
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,179
 Well,  I'm  glad

47
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:46,740
 we  could  have

48
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,759
 this  conversation,  Donald.

49
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,100
 Me  too,  Elon.

50
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:49,719
 Me  too.

51
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:50,759
 What  about  us?

52
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,840
 Great  question.

53
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,060
 Elon,  I  was

54
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:54,740
 lambda  is  a

55
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,079
 serverless  compute  service

56
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,219
 that  allows  you

57
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:57,939
 to  run  code

58
00:00:57,939 --> 00:00:59,259
 without  provisioning  or

59
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,399
 managing  servers.

60
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:01,259
 Exactly.

61
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,219
 And  it's  a

62
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:02,859
 venture  event.

63
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,979
 So  I  say

64
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:04,739
 forward  to  use.

65
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:05,879
 That's  right.

66
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:07,060
 Elon,  you're  a

67
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,239
 true  Oz  expert.

68
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,319
 Thanks,  Donald.

69
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,239
 I'm  just  trying

70
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:10,719
 to  help  people

71
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:11,420
 learn  about  Oz.

72
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,099
 Well,  you're  doing

73
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:13,840
 a  great  job,

74
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:14,200
 Elon.

75
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:15,340
 Thanks,  Donald.
